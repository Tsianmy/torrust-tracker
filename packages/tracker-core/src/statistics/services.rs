//! Statistics services.
//!
//! It includes:
//!
//! - A [`factory`](crate::statistics::setup::factory) function to build the structs needed to collect the tracker metrics.
//! - A [`get_metrics`] service to get the tracker [`metrics`](crate::core::statistics::metrics::Metrics).
//!
//! Tracker metrics are collected using a Publisher-Subscribe pattern.
//!
//! The factory function builds two structs:
//!
//! - An statistics event [`Sender`](crate::core::statistics::event::sender::Sender)
//! - An statistics [`Repository`]
//!
//! ```text
//! let (stats_event_sender, stats_repository) = factory(tracker_usage_statistics);
//! ```
//!
//! The statistics repository is responsible for storing the metrics in memory.
//! The statistics event sender allows sending events related to metrics.
//! There is an event listener that is receiving all the events and processing them with an event handler.
//! Then, the event handler updates the metrics depending on the received event.
//!
//! For example, if you send the event [`Event::Udp4Connect`](crate::core::statistics::event::Event::Udp4Connect):
//!
//! ```text
//! let result = event_sender.send_event(Event::Udp4Connect).await;
//! ```
//!
//! Eventually the counter for UDP connections from IPv4 peers will be increased.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! pub struct Metrics {
//!     // ...
//!     pub udp4_connections_handled: u64,  // This will be incremented
//!     // ...
//! }
//! ```
